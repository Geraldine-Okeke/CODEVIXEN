      whereto send the form data  when the user submits it. the method attribute is set to 'post' which tells the
      browser to send the data in the body of the HTTP request
      <br>
      <br>
      The &ltlabel&gt element is used to create  a  text label for the input field and for attribute is used to associate
      the label with the corresponding input field.the &ltinput&gt elements are used to create the text fields for the 
      username and password. the "type" attribute is set to "text"  for the username field and "password" for the 
      password field which tells the browser to mask the characters entered in the password field
      <br>
      <br>
      The required attribute is added to the input, which tells the browser that these fields must be filled out beforethe form
      must be submitted'
      <br>
      <br>
      The &ltinput type="submit"&gt is used to create asubmit button and the value attribute is set to "Login" which will be
      displayed on the button
